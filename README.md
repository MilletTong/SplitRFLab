SplitRFlab
==================
A MATLAB GUI toolbox to calculate P-wave receiver functions and H-k stacking.

This toolbox was modified by Splitlab (WÃ¼stefeld et. al.,) and processRFmatlab: https://github.com/iwbailey/processRFmatlab.git. We kept all functions in Splitlab and added functions to calculate P-wave receiver functions.

Notes: This toolbox CANNOT run at Windows with 64-bit MATLAB. Mac OS and Linux are recommended.
